This is a set of exercises designed to introduce R and to teach the basics of using [ggraph](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/) and [tidygraph](tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/) to visualize networks.

They are part of my course on [Communication and Social Networks](https://github.com/jdfoote/Communication-and-Social-Networks), but you should be able to follow along and learn most of what you need even without the benefit of my direct tutelage.
